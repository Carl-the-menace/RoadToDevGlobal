      <h5><b>Q: How to play</b></h5>
      <p>A: All you have to do is select your preferences on the landing page, click play and hopefully you will end up in a lobby with players matching you. By clicking the go to group button you will all be thrown into a Steam group from where you can invite eachother to a ingame lobby. One of the players in a lobby is assigned leader meaning he or she is responsible for arranging things. </p>
